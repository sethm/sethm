# About Me

Hi, I'm Seth, also known as **twylo**. I write software for fun and profit. I'm
primarily interested in simulation and emulation of historical computer
systems.

I have more or less entirely moved away from GitHub, so if you're looking for
something that I wrote that used to be here, it's probably on my self-hosted
Git repositories at [https://git.loomcom.com/seth](https://git.loomcom.com/seth?tab=activity).

It was fun while it lasted, but the ongoing
[enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) of the
platform by a company that is hell bent on forcing everyone to use LLMs whether
they like it or not has caused me no end of consternation.

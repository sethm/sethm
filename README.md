# About Me

Hi, I'm Seth, also known as **twylo**. I write software for fun and
profit. I'm primarily interested in simulation and emulation of
computer systems.

# Say, What Happened to All Your Repos?

I've moved all of my Git repositories from Github to
[my own hosted Gitlab instance](https://git.loomcom.com/seth).

Why? I felt that GitHub was getting a little too all-powerful
for my taste. I miss the more distributed, peer-to-peer Internet
of yesteryear. Hosting my own Gitlab instance gives me a little
more control over my own online destiny, and I like that.

Going forward, only forks will remain here on Github.
